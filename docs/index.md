## Welcome to Ruin UI v2 Documentation

Ruin UI v2 is complete refresh and rewrite of the first version.
This time around, we intend to make it more userfriendly and make you the user able to add your own stuff to the mod.

So outside of the default features Ruin UI v2 comes with (found in feature list).
We also introduce Addons, addons works as it sounds. You will now be able to add your own functionallity to  the UI Mod, without having to fiddle with Tampermonkey and similar.
